This is a simple script to make a wordcloud from a Twitter user's data.

To use the script, install R and, ideally, RStudio.

Download your user data from Twitter's Privacy & Settings area. Twitter advises that you be careful with these data, which apparently could contain sensitive information.

You must know how to specify the path to your user data file, and you must update that path in the script.

After the first time you run the script, put a # before the install.package commands, since the packages will already have been installed.

You can customize the wordcloud using the parameters described herein: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud/wordcloud.pdf

Save your wordcloud using PDF or another format that suits your purposes.

Have fun!
